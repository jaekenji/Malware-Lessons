# Reverse Shell

> Reverse shells invert the attack dynamic, turning targeted systems into unwitting accomplices that reach out through their own defenses to hand attackers the keys to the kingdom.

### What is it?

<p>if you need further explanation: its as if you pulled up command prompt on your computer, where the attack runs commands</p>

### Main Components
<p>Target Machine: The computer that has been compromised and is controlled remotely. It runs a reverse shell program that initiates the connection to the attacker’s listener.</p>
<p>Attacker’s Machine (Listener): The server or computer that receives the incoming connection from the target machine. It typically runs a listening service that waits for the reverse shell to connect.</p>
Network Communication: Utilizes standard networking protocols (often TCP/IP) to establish and maintain the connection between the target machine and the attacker's listener. Communication can be disguised or encrypted to evade detection.

The victim will always call back to the attacker with a reverse shell

### Overall Objective
The primary objective of a reverse shell is to allow an attacker to execute commands on a target machine remotely. This capability can be used for various malicious purposes, such as:

Data Theft: Extracting sensitive data from the target system.
System Manipulation: Installing malware, creating backdoors, or modifying system configurations.
Network Exploration: Using the compromised machine to conduct further attacks within the target network.
Reverse shells are particularly effective because they initiate the connection from the target to the attacker, often circumventing inbound firewall rules and detection systems that are designed to block unauthorized incoming connections. This makes reverse shells a potent tool for attackers who need stealthy and extensive access to compromised networks.
