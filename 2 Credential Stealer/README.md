# Credential Stealer

> Credential stealers are malicious programs designed to covertly collect sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other credentials from compromised systems.

### What is it?

<p>A credential stealer operates stealthily in the background, intercepting and exfiltrating sensitive data without the user's knowledge or consent.</p>

### Main Components

- **Data Collection Module:** This module is responsible for identifying and extracting sensitive information from various sources, including web browsers, email clients, saved passwords, and system files.
  
- **Data Exfiltration Module:** Once collected, the stolen credentials are packaged and sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This module handles the transmission of data over the network, often using encrypted channels to evade detection.

- **Persistence Mechanism:** To ensure continuous operation, credential stealers often employ persistence mechanisms such as registry entries, scheduled tasks, or startup scripts to maintain their presence on the compromised system even after reboots or system updates.

### Overall Objective

<p>What we want is to harvest creds silently, and exfiltrate them appropriately. Nothing else.</p>

<p><b>Our goal is to steal passwords, not destroy property, we arent savages.</b></p>

<p>What this might look like:</p>

```python
# Find the current users chrome "Local State"
local_state = "Chrome\\User Data\\Local State"

# Find all login data files "User Data"
user_data = "Chrome\\User Data"
profiles = [profile for profile in user_data]

# Grab Encryption Key
file = open(local_state)
file["os_crypt"]["encrypted_key"]

# Find all encrypted passwords
for profile in profiles:
    "SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins"

# Decrypt the passwords
decrypted_password = AES.new(encryption_key).decrypt(encrypted_password)
```

<p>Credential stealers pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike, emphasizing the importance of implementing robust security measures to detect and mitigate such attacks.</p>

-----

### Concluding

<p>By understanding how credential stealers operate and implementing proactive security measures, individuals and organizations can better protect themselves against the threat of data theft and unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity to safeguard sensitive information and maintain trust in digital ecosystems.</p>
