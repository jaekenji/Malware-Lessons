# Credential Stealer

> Credential stealers are malicious programs designed to covertly collect sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other credentials from compromised systems.

### What is it?

![image](https://github.com/jaekenji/Malware-Lessons/assets/credentials_stealer.png)

<p>A credential stealer operates stealthily in the background, intercepting and exfiltrating sensitive data without the user's knowledge or consent.</p>

### Main Components

- **Data Collection Module:** This module is responsible for identifying and extracting sensitive information from various sources, including web browsers, email clients, saved passwords, and system files.
  
- **Data Exfiltration Module:** Once collected, the stolen credentials are packaged and sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This module handles the transmission of data over the network, often using encrypted channels to evade detection.

- **Persistence Mechanism:** To ensure continuous operation, credential stealers often employ persistence mechanisms such as registry entries, scheduled tasks, or startup scripts to maintain their presence on the compromised system even after reboots or system updates.

### Overall Objective

<p>The primary objective of a credential stealer is to harvest valuable credentials that can be used for various malicious activities, including:</p>

- Identity Theft: Using stolen credentials to impersonate individuals and gain unauthorized access to accounts or sensitive information.
  
- Financial Fraud: Using stolen credit card information or banking credentials to make unauthorized transactions or drain funds from accounts.
  
- Espionage: Collecting sensitive corporate or government credentials for espionage purposes, such as accessing classified information or compromising critical infrastructure.

### Script Analysis

```python
import os
import shutil

def steal_credentials():
    # Copy browser history files
    browsers = ['Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Edge', 'Safari']
    for browser in browsers:
        history_file = f'C:\\Users\\{os.getlogin()}\\AppData\\Local\\{browser}\\User Data\\Default\\History'
        if os.path.exists(history_file):
            shutil.copy(history_file, f'{browser}_History')

    # Extract saved passwords
    # Code for extracting passwords goes here

    # Exfiltrate stolen data to remote server
    # Code for sending data to attacker's server goes here
if __name__ == "__main__":
    steal_credentials()
```

<p>Credential stealers pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike, emphasizing the importance of implementing robust security measures to detect and mitigate such attacks.</p>

### Conclusion

<p>By understanding how credential stealers operate and implementing proactive security measures, individuals and organizations can better protect themselves against the threat of data theft and unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity to safeguard sensitive information and maintain trust in digital ecosystems.</p>
