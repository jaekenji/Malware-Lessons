# Key Logging

> Keylogging captures the unspoken narrative of our digital interactions, turning every keystroke into a piece of a larger puzzle.

### What is it?

! image

<p>Keyloggers need to run constantly in order to pick up all key presses, which means we need to follow some rules</p>

### Main Components

<p>Method to detect key presses.</p>

<p>Method to record files.</p>

<p>Method to exfiltrate the data.</p>

##### What this may look like in code:

```
# Define or import our key library
key_log_library

# Detect key press
GetAsyncKeyState(scan_code)

# Convert scan code to key code with virtual key
character = MapVirtualKey(scan_code)

# Log to file
write(character, file)
```

This is as close as I could get it to look similar to python, powershell, or c

### Overall Objective

<p>The primary thing we are trying to accomplish is to capture the keys without interfering with the users current environment and record that data.</p>

- Data Theft: Extracting sensitive data from the target system.

<p>Keylogging is especially good at capturing ALL activity, not just crendtial harvesting.</p>

### Now lets get to coding !!!
