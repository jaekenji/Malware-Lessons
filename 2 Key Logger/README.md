# Key Logging

> Keylogging captures the unspoken narrative of our digital interactions, turning every keystroke into a piece of a larger puzzle.

### What is it?

<p>Keyloggers need to run constantly in order to pick up all key presses, which means we need to follow some rules</p>

### Main Components

<p>Method to detect key presses.</p>

<p>Method to record files.</p>

<p>Method to exfiltrate the data.</p>

##### What this may look like in code:

```
# Define or import our key library
key_log_library

# Detect key press
GetAsyncKeyState(scan_code)

# Convert scan code to key code with virtual key
character = MapVirtualKey(scan_code)

# Log to file
write(character, file)
```
